Next Year on January 16 2023, it is Marthin Luther King Day.
I like MLK said "I have a Dream". A Dream mean, you will try what you can do to catch your dream, even you never got it.

Like MLK do, service people may not impact immediately, but for the long term, that may help a lot of people, service people is not only for yourself, it is for the world.

*If you could go back in time and meet MLK, what would you say to him?*
I think I would say today is better than past, but could be better.

*What would you do to make the world a better place?*
I am a negligible person. I can't do something like Elon Musk, but that mean I would do anything to make the world better. I would like to try make do some share in internet, like this blog, hope some clever people read this and do something better than me. It is meaning I also do a good thing to make the world better?
