Next Year on January 16 2023, it is Marthin Luther King Day.
I like what MLK said "I have a Dream". A Dream means, you will try what you can do to catch your dream, even if you never get there.

Just like MLK did, service people do not impact immediately, but for the long term, that may help a lot of people, you do service not only for yourself, it is for the world.

*If you could go back in time and meet MLK, what would you say to him?*
I think I would say today is better than past, but could be even better.

*What would you do to make the world a better place?*
I am only one person. I can't do something big like Elon Musk, but that means I would still do anything to make the world better. I would like to share my ideas on internet, like this blog, I hope some clever people read this and do something better than me. Does this mean I am also do a good thing to make the world better?
