<h2>Cooking learn from Youtube</h2>


### I made a chicken Soup follow by Youtube, here is all ingredients

1. 4 medium Carrots
2. 4 Celery ribs
3. 1 medium onion
4. 1/2 cup parsley
5. 3 quarter pound of pork and 3 quarter pound of Beef
6. itialian seasoned breadcrumbs
7. peocorino romano
8. 2 cup of chicken stocks
9. chicken thighs
10. pasta (Farfalline no. 95)
11. 2 eggs
12. extra part of the chicken skin... but I don't recommond to add it, too oil
13. salt pepper

Dict carrots, onion and celery ribs. mince parsley, 
use a bigger pot and turn the heat to about medium to medium-low, put a little bit of olive oil down.
put the onion in the first right and two seconds later, put the carrot and celery.
let these soften up for about five minutes.
after five minutes, you can see they got a little bit of brightness to them.
put in two cups of chicken stocks and more water.
put all chicken thighs and chicken skin if you have it.
just get this to a boil, then loer it down to a simmer, take it like 35 to 45 minutes.
you can see all the foam that coming up to the top basically the scum.
you can start getting rid of a lot of it and just put it right in a cup whatever.

### made a meat balls
put all the pork and beef to pot, put about a teaspoon of salt and a half a teaspoon of pepper.
put two eggs, parsley and a half cup of pecorino and a cup of bread crumbs and spreading it out.
taking the tiniest bit of meat and rolling to a ball.

### Finally
you can let the soup sit for 30 minutes before skimming off more of the fat.
the best way is to make a day ahead and remove the hardened cold fat that rises to the top overnight.

take all your chicken out and all the skin out.

get all the chicken meat off, we don't want get any of the bones
put all the chicken meat back to the soup.
put all the meat ball to the soup but don't dump them all in at the same time.

let it go aound 5 minutes here we go.
